## Project Description
The R package at /Users/jamesharris/Documents/R/RKoopmanDMD contains R code and research about Koopman DMD for use as a machine learning library.

The goal here is to build a Rust implementation of the library's features, along with R and Python APIs to call the Rust code. You may use any and all of the resources in the repository, as well as any academic papers online not referenced in the repo.

## Objective
Creating and using whatever subagents or agent teams are needed, develop a complete plan for implementing the project in phases. Store the plan as a markdown document and await further instructions
